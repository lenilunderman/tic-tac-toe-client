**User Stories**

As a user, I want to create an account and be able to login in
As a user, I want to be able to play the game and reset the game as I wish
As a user, I want to see the number of victories I have
As a user, I want to be able to reset my password
As a user, I want to be able to secure the log out of the website.

**Planning Story**
The user will have to create an account to get access to the game, once the user is log in, he will receive options on the page, such as to play the game, start a new game and reset the game score, change password and logout.

**Updates for the Future - Spin Game**

For the future if all goes well, I will add a dark-mode theme for the game, and give the user options to choose an icon selector for the game.
